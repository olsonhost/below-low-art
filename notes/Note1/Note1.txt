TODONK

+ Make room 1 into 2 different surface rooms separated by a mountain
+ Walk into ghost town buildings for exposition and/or things
+ Lifting Wall (for like an elevator)

+ Lighting - light up when gun fired, make caves dark, flashlight, fire
	Lighting is hard :(
	

Need a different gun sound for inside the caves.


Transitions different
Walking man from Wild Wild West animation
Draw and shoot
Flame thrower animation and sound (particle system?)
Light things on fire (particle system?)
Melting rock (how?) (particle system?)
Inventory
Crouch to change guns, reload, pause game
Xbox controller play
Exposition call-out, show character, lines being spoken 
(you can also take this opportunity to briefly describe the character who is speaking for implicit exposition)
Rain would be cool (but for no reason - maybe at the end an in the title screen)

Include a summary of the book and links where people can get it.  Make this a mainstay of BR games.
Add that ^ to the main menu - link to BR website wiki (hey!)
